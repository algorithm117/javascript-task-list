# Task List App

This project is a slight twist on the idea of a to-do app. 
It's intended to give a pleasant experience when typing out 
your tasks with some music and interactivity using animations.

## Motivation

The project was born out of the idea of taking something that many
people start out making or at least encounter when creating their 
first coding project and making it more fun. It is also meant 
to be a playground for testing out new things, and getting a gauge
of my current skill level and understanding with HTML, CSS, 
& JavaScript.
